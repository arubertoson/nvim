Evaluates environmental factors such as lighting, reflections, and accessories, as well as head position and camera angle, which may distort perception. Ensures eyes are visible and the image quality allows for proper assessment. Annotations include bounding boxes for glasses, labeled attributes (e.g., glare, misalignment), and qualitative observations. Images with severe obstructions or distortions are marked as unsuitable for analysis."
